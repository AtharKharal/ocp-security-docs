This document outlines the security policies governing the development, deployment, and maintenance of this system. All personnel and stakeholders must comply with these guidelines to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and infrastructure.

== 1. Access Control

All access to systems and data must follow the principle of least privilege.

* Users must authenticate using multi-factor authentication (MFA).
* Role-based access control (RBAC) must be enforced for all services.
* Temporary access (e.g., for contractors) must be time-bound and logged.
* Shared accounts are strictly prohibited.
* Access reviews are conducted quarterly.

== 2. Data Protection

Sensitive data must be stored, processed, and transmitted securely.

* Data at rest must be encrypted using AES-256 or stronger.
* Data in transit must use TLS 1.2+.
* All personally identifiable information (PII) must be masked or anonymized where appropriate.
* Backups must be encrypted and tested monthly for recoverability.

== 3. Secure Development

Development processes must integrate security from the start.

* All code repositories must use signed commits and enforce branch protection.
* Static code analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, CodeQL) must be integrated in CI.
* Dependencies must be vetted and updated regularly; known vulnerabilities must be remediated within 7 days.
* Secrets must never be hardcoded and must be stored using a secret manager (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

== 4. Incident Response

Every security incident must be logged, triaged, and resolved through a documented process.

* An incident response plan (IRP) must be in place and reviewed biannually.
* Incidents must be categorized by severity and tracked via an incident management system.
* Forensics must be initiated within 2 hours of a critical breach.
* Post-incident reviews must produce a root cause analysis (RCA) and corrective actions.

== 5. Logging and Monitoring

Continuous monitoring is required to detect and respond to threats.

* Centralized logging must be implemented using a secure, tamper-evident system (e.g., ELK, Splunk).
* Logs must be retained for a minimum of 90 days.
* All login attempts, file access, and privilege escalations must be logged.
* Anomalous behavior must trigger alerts via a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform.

== 6. Endpoint Security

All endpoints must be hardened, monitored, and updated.

* Anti-malware software must be installed and updated automatically.
* USB access must be disabled unless explicitly approved.
* Devices must auto-lock after 5 minutes of inactivity.
* Operating systems and software must be patched within 72 hours of critical vulnerability disclosure.

== 7. Physical Security

Physical access to infrastructure and equipment must be strictly controlled.

* Data centers must implement 24/7 surveillance and biometric access control.
* Visitor access must be logged and supervised at all times.
* Workstations must not be left unattended in unlocked state.

== 8. Third-Party Risk Management

Vendors and service providers must meet defined security standards.

* A security review is required before onboarding any third-party vendor.
* Data processing agreements (DPAs) must be signed where applicable.
* Annual compliance checks are mandatory for high-risk vendors.

== 9. Policy Review and Compliance

These policies are reviewed semi-annually by the Security Committee.

* All team members must undergo security awareness training annually.
* Non-compliance may result in disciplinary action.
* Changes to policies must be documented and approved through the Change Advisory Board (CAB).
